TrueCrypt License Version 2.0


I. Definitions 

1. "This product" means the parts of the computer software, including, but not
limited to, source code, texts, graphics, and any accompanying files, released
under and covered by this version of this License. 

2. "You" (or "your") means an individual or a legal entity (e.g., a non-profit
organization, commercial organization, government agency, etc.) exercising 
permissions granted by this License. 



II. Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Use

1. You may copy and/or distribute this product without any restrictions,
provided that the product is not modified and that it is not repackaged (for
terms and conditions for copying and distribution of modified or repackaged
versions of this product, see Section III.)

2. You may use this product freely (see also Section III.) on single or
multiple computers/systems for non-commercial and/or commercial uses.



III. Terms and Conditions for Modification and Derivation of New Products

1. You may modify this product (this also covers implementation of new
features/functionalities, translation into another language, and porting to
another platform), derive new works from this product, include/use this product
or its portion in (or as part of) your product, and you may copy and distribute
such modifications, derivative or aggregated works as your product, provided
that the following conditions are met (for exceptions, see Sections III.2.
and III.3.):

    a. Your product or the modified version must not be called TrueCrypt and
    its name must not contain the name TrueCrypt (for example, the following
    names are not allowed: TrueCrypt+, TrueCrypt Professional, etc.) nor any of
    its variations that can be easily confused with the name TrueCrypt (e.g.,
    Truecrypt, True-Crypt, True Crypt, TrueKrypt, TruCrypt, etc.)

    Note: TrueCrypt is a trademark of the TrueCrypt Foundation. The goal is not
    to monetize the name or the product, but to protect the reputation of
    TrueCrypt, and to prevent support issues and other kinds of issues that
    might arise from the existence of similar products with the same or similar
    name. Even though TrueCrypt is a trademark, TrueCrypt is and will remain
    open-source and free software.

    b. The following phrases must be removed from the "About" dialog (the
    credits), from this License (Section VI.), and from any other accompanying
    materials:
    "A TrueCrypt Foundation Release"
    "Released by TrueCrypt Foundation"
    "This is a TrueCrypt Foundation release."

    c. Phrase "Based on TrueCrypt" must be displayed by your product (if
    technically feasible) or by the modified version and contained in its 
    documentation. Alternatively, if this product or its portion you included
    in your product comprise only a minor portion of your product, phrase 
    "Portions of this product are based in part on TrueCrypt" may be used
    instead.

    d. Complete source code of your product or of the modified version must be
    freely and publicly available. If the source code is not included with
    every copy of your product/modifications, there must be a well-publicized
    means of obtaining the source code, preferably, downloading via the
    Internet without charge. The source code must not be deliberately 
    obfuscated, and it must not be in an intermediate form (e.g., the output of
    a preprocessor). Source code means the preferred form in which a programmer
    would usually modify the program. 

    e. The license and distribution terms of no part of this product may be
    changed (i.e., no part of this product can be put under another license),
    except as expressly permitted or required by this License. The legal 
    notices contained in the source code files must be retained. It must be 
    clearly declared that this product or its parts are distributed under the
    TrueCrypt License (contained herein), and it must be clearly and visibly 
    stated in the distribution where the text of the TrueCrypt License can be 
    found (you may amend the references to the file 'License.txt' in the source
    code accordingly). The text of the TrueCrypt License must accompany (be
    distributed along with) your product/modifications. (Any of the Component
    Legal Notices contained below in this file may be omitted if the component
    to which it pertains is not used. If no cryptographic components of this
    product are used, Section IV.3. may be omitted as well.)


2. You are not obligated to comply with Sections III.1.a., III.1.b., III.1.c.,
and III.1.d. if at least one of the following conditions is met:

    a. You include this product in its entirety and without any modifications
    in an operating system distribution (i.e., you include binaries obtained by
    compiling the unmodified source code of this product and/or you include the
    unmodified contents of the source code distribution archive and/or of the
    binary distribution archive).

    b. You include this product in its entirety (the contents of either the
    source code distribution archive and/or of the binary distribution archive)
    and without any modifications as non-integral part of your product (i.e.,
    the main functionality of your product will not be affected if such
    non-integral part is removed) and phrase "This product utilizes TrueCrypt"
    or "This product includes TrueCrypt" is displayed by your product (if
    technically feasible) and contained in its documentation.


3. You are not obligated to comply with Section III.1.d. if at least one of the
following conditions is met:

    a. Your product/modifications (as defined in Section III.1.) are not
    distributed (i.e., your product/modifications are available only to you).

    b. Your product/modifications (as defined in Section III.1.) are
    distributed and used only internally within the organization and only by
    members/employees of the organization for which you created the
    product/modifications and of which you were a member/employee when you
    created the product/modifications. (Here the word "organization" means
    a non-commercial or commercial organization, or a government agency.)
