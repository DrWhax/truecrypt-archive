None of the component licenses applies to this product as a whole, even when it
uses the phrase "this product" or any other equivalent term/phrase. Unless
otherwise stated, graphics and files that are not part of the source code are
governed solely by the TrueCrypt License. Note: The TrueCrypt License is one of
the component licenses of which the TrueCrypt Collective License consists.

exercising permissions granted by this License.

3. "Modification" means (and "modify" refers to) any alteration of This
Product, including, but not limited to, addition to or deletion from the
substance or structure of This Product, and translation into another language.

4. "Your Product" means This Product modified by You, any work You derive from
(or base on) This Product, any work in which You include This Product, or any
respective part(s) thereof.

5. "Distribution" means (and "distribute" refers to), regardless of means or
methods, conveyance, transfer, providing, or making available of This/Your
Product or portions thereof to third parties (including, but not limited to,
making This/Your Product, or portions thereof, available for download to third
parties, whether or not any third party has downloaded the product, or any
portion thereof, made available for download).



II. Terms and Conditions for Use, Copying, and Distribution

1. You may copy and/or distribute This Product, provided that You do not modify
This Product (for terms and conditions for copying and distribution of modified
versions of This Product, see Chapter III) and provided that You do not include
This Product in another product (except as permitted under Chapter III), and
provided that You ensure that all the legal notices and documents (containing,
e.g., the text of this License, references to this License, etc.) included with
This Product are included with every copy of This Product that You make and
distribute, and provided that You comply with all other applicable terms and
conditions of this License.

2. Provided that You comply with all applicable terms and conditions of this
License, You may use This Product freely (see also Chapter III) on any number
of computers/systems for non-commercial and/or commercial purposes.



III. Terms and Conditions for Modification and Derivation of New Products

1. If all conditions specified in the following paragraphs in this Chapter
(III) are met (for exceptions, see Sections III.2 and III.3) and if You comply
with all other applicable terms and conditions of this License, You may modify
This Product (thus forming Your Product), derive new works from This Product or
portions thereof (thus forming Your Product), include This Product or portions
thereof in another product (thus forming Your Product), and You may copy and/or
distribute Your Product.

    a. The name of Your Product (or of Your modified version of This Product)
    must not contain the name TrueCrypt (for example, the following names are
    not allowed: TrueCrypt, TrueCrypt+, TrueCrypt Professional, iTrueCrypt,
    etc.) nor any other names confusingly similar to the name TrueCrypt (e.g.,
    True-Crypt, True Crypt, TruKrypt, etc.)

    Note: TrueCrypt and the TrueCrypt logos are trademarks of the TrueCrypt
    Foundation. The goal is not to monetize the name or the product, but to
    protect the reputation of TrueCrypt, and to prevent support issues and
    other kinds of issues that might arise from the existence of similar
    products with the same or similar name. Even though TrueCrypt and the
    TrueCrypt logos are trademarks, TrueCrypt is and will remain open-source
    and free software.

    All occurrences of the name TrueCrypt that could reasonably be considered
    to identify Your Product must be removed from Your Product and from any
    associated materials. Logo(s) included in (or attached to) Your Product
    (and in/to associated materials) must not incorporate and must not be
    confusingly similar to any of the TrueCrypt logos (including the
    non-textual logo consisting primarily of a key in stylized form) or
    portion(s) thereof. All graphics contained in This Product (logos, icons,
    etc.) must be removed from Your Product (or from Your modified version of
    This Product) and from any associated materials.

    b. The following phrases must be removed from Your Product and from any
    associated materials, except the text of this License: "A TrueCrypt
    Foundation Release", "Released by TrueCrypt Foundation", "This is a
    TrueCrypt Foundation release."

    c. Phrase "Based on TrueCrypt, freely available at
    http://www.truecrypt.org/" must be displayed by Your Product (if
    technically feasible) and contained in its documentation. Alternatively, if
    This Product or its portion You included in Your Product constitutes only a
    minor portion of Your Product, phrase "Portions of this product are based
    in part on TrueCrypt, freely available at http://www.truecrypt.org/" may be
    displayed instead. In each of the cases mentioned above in this paragraph,
    "http://www.truecrypt.org/" must be a hyperlink (if technically feasible)
    pointing to http://www.truecrypt.org/ and You may freely choose the
    location within the user interface (if there is any) of Your Product (e.g.,
    an "About" window, etc.) and the way in which Your Product will display the
    respective phrase.

    Your Product (and any associated materials, e.g., the documentation, the
    content of the official web site of Your Product, etc.) must not present
    any Internet address containing the domain name truecrypt.org (or any
    domain name that forwards to the domain name truecrypt.org) in a manner
    that might suggest that it is where information about Your Product may be
    obtained or where bugs found in Your Product may be reported or where
    support for Your Product may be available or otherwise attempt to indicate
    that the domain name truecrypt.org is associated with Your Product.

    d. The complete source code of Your Product must be freely and publicly
    available (for exceptions, see Sections III.2 and III.3) at least until You
    cease to distribute Your Product. To meet this condition, it is sufficient
    that You merely include the source code with every copy of Your Product
    that You make and distribute; it is also sufficient that You merely include
    information (valid and correct at least until You cease to distribute Your
    Product) about where the source code can be freely obtained (e.g., an
    Internet address, etc.) with every copy of Your Product that You make and
    distribute. Portions of the source code that were created by You (e.g. Your
    additions to This Product) must be available under license(s) that are/is
    compatible with this version of the TrueCrypt License (however, see also
    Subsection III.1.e) and that allow(s) anyone to modify and derive new works
    from Your Product (and portions thereof) and to use, copy, and redistribute
    such modifications and/or derivative works. The license(s) must be
    perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge, and worldwide, and must
    not invalidate, weaken, restrict, interpret, amend, modify, interfere with
    or otherwise affect any part, term, provision, or clause of this License.
    The text of the license(s) must be included with every copy of Your Product
    that You make and distribute. The source code must not be deliberately
    obfuscated, and it must not be in an intermediate form (e.g., the output of
    a preprocessor). Source code means the preferred form in which a programmer
    would usually modify the program.

    Note: If you cannot comply with the above requirements, we may grant an
    exception under certain conditions. You may request an exception at:
    licensing@truecrypt.org

    e. You must not change the license terms of This Product in any way (adding
    any new terms is considered changing the license terms even if the original
    terms are retained), which means, e.g., that no part of This Product may be
    put under another license. You must keep intact all the legal notices
    contained in the source code files. You must include the following items
    with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute: a clear and
    conspicuous notice stating that Your Product or portion(s) thereof is/are
    distributed under this version of the TrueCrypt License, a verbatim copy of
    this version of the TrueCrypt License (as contained herein), a clear and
    conspicuous notice containing information about where the included copy of
    the License can be found, and an appropriate copyright notice.

    f. Without specific prior written permission from the authors of This
    Product (or from their common representative), You must not use the name of
    This Product, the names of the authors of This Product, or the names of the
    legal entities (or informal groups) of which the authors were/are
    members/employees, to endorse or promote Your Product (or You, or Your
    affiliates), or in a way that might suggest that Your Product (or You, or
    Your affiliates) is/are endorsed by one or more authors of This Product, or
    in a way that might suggest that one or more authors of This Product is/are
    affiliated with You or directly participated in the creation of Your
    Product.


2. You are not obligated to comply with Subsections III.1.a, III.1.b, III.1.c,
and III.1.d, if all conditions specified in one of the two following
Subsections (III.2.a or III.2.b) are met:

    a. Your Product is an operating system distribution, or other aggregate
    software distribution (such as a cover CD-ROM of a magazine) containing
    products from different sources, in which You include either This Product
    without any modifications or file(s) which You obtain by compiling the
    unmodified source code of This Product.

    b. You include This Product in its entirety and without any modifications
    (You may omit the source code of This Product) as non-integral part of Your
    Product (i.e., none of the main functionalities of Your Product will be
    affected if such non-integral part is removed) and phrase "This product
    utilizes TrueCrypt, freely available at http://www.truecrypt.org/" or
    phrase "This product includes TrueCrypt, freely available at
    http://www.truecrypt.org/" is displayed by Your Product (if technically
    feasible) and contained in its documentation. In each of the cases
    mentioned above in this paragraph, "http://www.truecrypt.org/" must be a
    hyperlink (if technically feasible) pointing to http://www.truecrypt.org/
    and You may freely choose the location within the user interface (if there
    is any) of Your Product (e.g., an "About" window, etc.) and the way in
    which Your Product will display the respective phrase.


3. You are not obligated to comply with Subsection III.1.d if Your Product is
not distributed (i.e., Your Product is available only to You).



IV. Limitation of Liability, Disclaimer of Warranty, Indemnification
