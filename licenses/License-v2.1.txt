TrueCrypt Collective License Version 1.0


The TrueCrypt Collective License consists of several distinct licenses, which
are contained in this document (separated by lines consisting of underscores)
and which are, in this section, referred to as component licenses. Each of the
component licenses applies only to (portions of) the source code file(s) in
which the component license is contained or in which it is explicitly
referenced, and to compiled or otherwise processed forms of such source code.
None of the component licenses applies to this product as a whole, even when it
uses the phrase "this product" or any other equivalent term/phrase. Unless
otherwise stated, graphics and files that are not part of the source code are
covered solely by the TrueCrypt License.
Note: The TrueCrypt License is one of the component licenses of which the
TrueCrypt Collective License consists.

Anyone who uses and/or reproduces and/or modifies and/or (re)distributes any
part(s) of work made available under this version of the TrueCrypt Collective
License, is, by such action(s), accepting in full the responsibilities and
obligations contained in the component licenses that apply to the corresponding
part(s) of such work.

If any term of this license is found to be invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
terms of this license that are found to be valid and enforceable under
applicable law.

TrueCrypt License Version 2.1


I. Definitions

1. "This Product" means the work (including, but not limited to, source code,
graphics, texts, and accompanying files) made available under and covered by
this version of this License, as indicated by a copyright notice attached to or
included in the work.

2. "You" (or "Your") means an individual or a legal entity (e.g., a non-profit
organization, commercial organization, government agency, etc.) exercising
rights under this License.

3. "Modification" means any alteration of This Product, including, but not
limited to, addition to or deletion from the substance or structure of This
Product, and translation into another language.

4. "Your Product" means This Product modified by You, any work You derive from
(or base on) This Product, any work in which You include This Product, or any
respective part(s) thereof.



II. Terms and Conditions for Use, Reproduction, and Distribution

1. You may copy and/or distribute This Product, provided that You do not modify
any part of This Product (for terms and conditions for reproduction and
distribution of modified versions of This Product, see Section III) and
provided that You ensure that all the legal notices and documents (containing,
e.g., the text of this License, references to this License, etc.) included with
This Product are included with every copy of This Product that you make and
distribute.

2. You may use This Product freely (see also Section III) on any number of
computers/systems for non-commercial and/or commercial purposes.



III. Terms and Conditions for Modification and Derivation of New Products

1. You may modify This Product (thus forming Your Product), derive new works
from This Product or portions thereof (thus forming Your Product), include This
Product or portions thereof in another product (thus forming Your Product), and
You may copy and/or distribute Your Product, only if the following conditions
are met (for exceptions, see Sections III.2 and III.3):

    a. The name of Your Product (or of Your modified version of This Product)
    must not contain the name TrueCrypt (for example, the following names are
    not allowed: TrueCrypt, TrueCrypt+, TrueCrypt Professional, iTrueCrypt,
    etc.) nor any of its variations that can be easily confused with the name
    TrueCrypt (e.g., True-Crypt, True Crypt, TrueKrypt, TruCrypt, etc.)

    Note: TrueCrypt is a trademark of the TrueCrypt Foundation. The goal is not
    to monetize the name or the product, but to protect the reputation of
    TrueCrypt, and to prevent support issues and other kinds of issues that
    might arise from the existence of similar products with the same or similar
    name. Even though TrueCrypt is a trademark, TrueCrypt is and will remain
    open-source and free software.

    b. The following phrases must be removed from Your Product:
    "A TrueCrypt Foundation Release"
    "Released by TrueCrypt Foundation"
    "This is a TrueCrypt Foundation release."

    c. Phrase "Based on TrueCrypt, freely available at
    http://www.truecrypt.org/" must be displayed by Your Product (if
    technically feasible) and contained in its documentation. Alternatively, if
    This Product or its portion You included in Your Product comprises only a
    minor portion of Your Product, phrase "Portions of this product are based
    in part on TrueCrypt, freely available at http://www.truecrypt.org/" may be
    displayed instead. In each of the cases mentioned above in this paragraph,
    "http://www.truecrypt.org/" must be a hyperlink (if technically feasible)
    pointing to http://www.truecrypt.org/ and you may freely choose the
    location within the user interface (if there is any) of Your Product (e.g.,
    an "About" window, etc.) and the way in which Your Product will display the
    respective phrase.

    d. The complete source code of Your Product must be freely and publicly
    available (for exceptions, see Section III.3) at least until you cease to
    distribute Your Product. To meet this condition, it is sufficient that You
    merely include the source code with every copy of Your Product that you
    make and distribute; it is also sufficient that You merely include
    information (valid and correct at least until you cease to distribute Your
    Product) about where the source code can be freely obtained (e.g., an
    Internet URL, etc.) with every copy of Your Product that you make and
    distribute. The source code must not be deliberately obfuscated, and it
    must not be in an intermediate form (e.g., the output of a preprocessor).
    Source code means the preferred form in which a programmer would usually
    modify the program.

    e. You must not change the license and distribution terms of This Product
    (i.e., no part of This Product may be put under another license), except as
    expressly permitted or required by this License. You must keep intact all
    the legal notices contained in the source code files. You must include the
    following items with every copy of Your Product that you make and
    distribute: a clear and conspicuous notice stating that Your Product or
    portion(s) thereof is/are distributed under this version of the TrueCrypt
    License, a verbatim copy of this version of the TrueCrypt License (as
    contained herein), a clear and conspicuous notice containing information
    about where the included copy of the License can be found, and an
    appropriate copyright notice.

    f. You must not use the name of This Product, names of its authors, or the
    names of the legal entities (or informal groups) of which the authors
    were/are members/employees, to endorse or promote Your Product without
    specific prior written permission from the authors of This Product.


2. You are not obligated to comply with Sections III.1.a, III.1.b, III.1.c,
III.1.d, and III.1.f, if all conditions specified in one of the two following
paragraphs are met:

    a. Your Product is an operating system distribution, or other aggregate
    software distribution (such as a cover CD-ROM of a magazine) containing
    products from different sources, in which You include either This Product
    without any modifications or file(s) which You obtain by compiling the
    unmodified source code of This Product.

    b. You include This Product in its entirety and without any modifications
    (You may omit the source code of This Product) as non-integral part of Your
    Product (i.e., none of the main functionalities of Your Product will be
    affected if such non-integral part is removed) and phrase "This product
    utilizes TrueCrypt, freely available at http://www.truecrypt.org/" or
    phrase "This product includes TrueCrypt, freely available at
    http://www.truecrypt.org/" is displayed by Your Product (if technically
    feasible) and contained in its documentation. In each of the cases
    mentioned above in this paragraph, "http://www.truecrypt.org/" must be a
    hyperlink (if technically feasible) pointing to http://www.truecrypt.org/
    and you may freely choose the location within the user interface (if there
    is any) of Your Product (e.g., an "About" window, etc.) and the way in
    which Your Product will display the respective phrase.


3. You are not obligated to comply with Section III.1.d if Your Product is not
distributed (i.e., Your Product is available only to You).
