TCHead Release Notes

* General

TCHead only decrypts the header, nothing else. To decrypt further,
use the discovered password with TrueCrypt to perform a mount.

* Build

To compile TCHead, you need a modern C++ compiler, Boost and Botan. 
See the build scripts for details on linking, etc. It's simple to build.
Statically linked binaries for Linux are provided.
