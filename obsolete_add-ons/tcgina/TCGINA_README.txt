TCGINA

Description: TCGINA allows the use of TrueCrypt to on-the-fly encrypt a 
Windows user profile. A Windows user profile usually contains user registry 
files, user documents and settings, temporary files, etc. TCGINA detects 
whether a user profile is encrypted (stored on a TrueCrypt volume) and mounts 
the corresponding TrueCrypt volume before continuing the Windows log on 
procedure.
TCGINA is implemented as a stub GINA and works together with the original 
Windows GINA (MSGINA DLL) or with a custom GINA.

Note: A more secure and more reliable method to encrypt user profiles is to 
encrypt the system partition. TCGINA is only then a preferable method if 
system encryption is not an option.
